# Week 19
Now that I am a lot more comfortable with golang I want to start applying it to projects. I would also like to learn new technologies to my projects that im working on, like CloudPC, JiraDownloader, La Salle Schedule, and Digital-Engineer.
For example I would like to be more comfortable with redis and mongodb in golang, to use on projects like networked-functions. 

Best case scenario: To start a company that sells the cloudpc technology to clients.


Minimum Viable Product: Develop new projects that I havent come up with yet. If that doesnt work further polish existing projects, or port more projects to golang.
