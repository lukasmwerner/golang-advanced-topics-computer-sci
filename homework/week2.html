<p>Goal: Finish the programs from the first chapter</p>
<p>I was able to finish the all the programs from the first chapter. Quite the long chapter but it is a good introduction into the language and its conventions. The first thing that I noticed was that to be able to access a function that was exported was to use <code>UpperCammel</code> case. Which from <code>APCS</code> im not used to from java where <code>lowerCammelCase</code> was the preferd formating for that class.</p>
