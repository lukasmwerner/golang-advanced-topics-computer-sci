# Week 2 Homework

Goal: Finish the programs from the first chapter

I was able to finish the all the programs from the first chapter. Quite the long chapter but it is a good introduction into the language and its conventions. The first thing that I noticed was that to be able to access a function that was exported was to use `UpperCammel` case. Which from `APCS` im not used to from java where `lowerCammelCase` was the preferd formating for that class.
